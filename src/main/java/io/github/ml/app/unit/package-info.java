/**
 * This package contains code for implementation of regression using unit structures
 * of real values rather than matrices or hybrid models implemented by libraries.
 *
 * Where this model fails is limited scope of use in that changes in attributes may need to
 * be coded, and also that use of loops leads to less that lively performance, this is as opposed
 * to using matrices, as implemented by the so called libraries
